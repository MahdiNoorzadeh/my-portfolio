export const HERO_CONTENT = `Hi there! I'm Mahdi Noorzadeh, a passionate and dedicated entry-level backend programmer and indie game developer from Gonbad-e Qabus, Iran. I've been a tech enthusiast since childhood, diving deep into the world of technology and gaming. I co-founded Madness Eyes Games, where I poured my creativity into crafting engaging stories and characters. My journey has also taken me through roles as a social media manager, where I honed my skills in content creation and community engagement. Now, I’m channeling my love for coding into building innovative solutions. I believe in working smart and always strive to find the most efficient ways to tackle challenges. When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying music, hiking, or getting lost in a good game. Let's connect and create something amazing together!`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `An engineer with a mind full of ideas, I’m known for my honesty and, yes, sometimes a bit of laziness and being a sleepyhead. But when I'm awake, I'm all about teamwork and the positive energy it brings. I thrive in collaborative environments and love being a team player. Despite my relaxed demeanor, I'm passionate and driven when it comes to turning creative concepts into reality.`;
